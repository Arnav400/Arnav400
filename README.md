# 👋 Hey, I'm Arnav Sen (@Arnav400)

I'm a developer who enjoys solving real problems with clean, efficient code. Whether it's building useful tools, exploring new tech, or just trying to make sense of bugs at 11PM (yup I try to sleep early) — I’m in it for the learning.

## 🔍 Interests
- Systems that work well and look good doing it  
- Clean code, clever optimizations, and solid architecture  
- Real-world applications that aren't just "cool" but *useful*

## 📚 Currently Learning
- Deep-diving into **React**, **Node.js**, and modern web dev stacks  
- Software engineering principles that scale beyond side projects  
- Sharpening my **DSA** and (a bit , like salt in food)**systems design** chops

## 🤝 Open to Collaborate On
- Interesting open-source projects  
- Anything that mixes creativity with logic  
- Tools that solve small but real pain points for devs or users

## ⚡ Fun Fact
You will never see me and Batman in the same room.
I drink a lot of black coffee, enjoy watching trees (seriously), and believe that clarity in code — like in life — is underrated.
